## Smart AI-Based Resume Parser

### Overview
The **Smart AI-Based Resume Parser** is a Django-powered web application designed to automate and enhance the resume screening process. Leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it extracts structured data—such as skills, experience, education, and personal details—from resumes in various formats. The system enables precise candidate shortlisting by matching resumes to job requirements, reducing processing time, minimizing bias, and improving recruitment efficiency.

### Features

- **Multi-Format Resume Upload:** Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and scanned documents (JPG, PNG, JPEG).

- **Advanced Filtering:** Filters candidates based on:
  - Education Level (e.g., Bachelor, Master, PhD)
  - Minimum Experience (calculated from date ranges like "July 2024 – Dec 2024" or "Dec 2024 – Present")
  - Skills (selectable from dropdown)
  - Keywords (for contextual matching)
- **Candidate Ranking:** Scores and ranks resumes based on relevance to job criteria.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Reduces human bias through automated, data-driven shortlisting.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Modern, responsive design with AOS animations and toast notifications.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built for easy integration with HR systems and large-scale recruitment pipelines.
